# JobFlow AI — Investor Overview

## One-Line Summary
JobFlow AI is a job search command center that auto-tracks applications from email, measures conversion by resume and source, and gives candidates and hiring teams a shared workflow.

## Problem
Job seekers track applications manually, lose responses in email, and lack clear feedback loops.
Hiring teams post across multiple sources with no unified applicant status view.

## Solution
JobFlow AI connects email + job sources + partner job board into a single pipeline:
- Auto‑detects application status from Gmail.
- Shows bottlenecks via Sankey analytics.
- Lets employers update applicant status in a CRM that syncs to the candidate view.

## Core Features
- Google OAuth login
- Email sync (Gmail) for application updates
- Job board + quick apply
- Resume performance analytics
- Drag‑and‑drop pipeline
- Partner company dashboard & CRM
- Admin controls for approvals and user management

## Moat / Differentiation
Most trackers are manual and single‑sided. JobFlow AI is dual‑sided:
candidate workflow + employer CRM with shared status sync.

Subscription tiers for candidates + employer posting/CRM plans.
